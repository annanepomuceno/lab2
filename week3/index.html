    <p><u><b>Senior HighSchool Graduated:</b></u> Asia Pacific College</p>
    <p><u><b>College:</b></u> Asia Pacific College</p>
    <p><u><b>Scholarship:</b></u> Public School Graduate (50% Tuition Fee)</p>
    <p><u><b>Course:</b></u> Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Specializing in Mobile and internet Technology
    </p>
    <p><u><b>Why did you choose this course: </b></u> When I was in Grade 9, I got interested in programming because
        of the ICT subject where we studied Visual Basic, and I got high grades. <br>My teacher recommended this
        course since I am not sure what course I will take, and that’s why I have decided to take this in SHS;<br> I
        started my specialization in I.T. in STEM at Asia Pacific College.
    </p>
    <p><u><b>I.T Experience: Programming / Other: </b></u> My first programming language was Visual Basic and HTML,
        which we learned in my grade 9 days.<br> Then, I started learning CSS, J.S., JAVA and more in my senior year,
        where we studied it in our programming subjects.</p>
