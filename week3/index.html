    <h2><center>*✧･ﾟSchool Information･ *✧･ﾟ</center></h2>
    <p><u><b>Senior HighSchool Graduated:</b></u>Asia Pacific College</p>
    <p><u><b>College:</b></u>Asia Pacific College</p>
    <p><u><b>Scholarship:</b></u>Public School Graduate (50% Tuition Fee)</p>
	<p><u><b>Course:</b></u>: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Specializing in Mobile and internet
Technology</p>
    <p><u><b>Why did you choose this course: </b></u> When I was in Grade 9, I got interested in programming because of the ICT subject <br>
where we studied Visual Basic, and I got high grades. My teacher recommended this<br>
course since I am not sure what course I will take, and that’s why I have decided to take<br>
this in SHS; I started my specialization in I.T. in STEM at Asia Pacific College.
 </p> 
    <p><u><b>I.T Experience: Programming / Other: </b></u> My first programming language was Visual Basic and HTML, which we learned in my grade <br>
9 days. Then, I started learning CSS, J.S., JAVA and more in my senior year, where we studied<br>
it in our programming subjects.</p>
